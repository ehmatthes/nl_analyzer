Newsletter pricing tool
---

If you're comparing newsletter platforms, it's not entirely straightfoward to compare the cost of different platforms against each other. There are a number of factors that affect how much you'll pay for hosting:

- How many total subscribers do you have?
- What portion of your subscribers are on paid plans?
- What's the average annual revenue per subscriber, taking into account discounts and various plan levels?
- What features do you need from the platform?

This tool helps you see what *your* costs are likely to be on each of the major platforms.
